The Roman religion was in fact\nof the nature of a bargain: men paid certain sacrifices and rites, and\nthe gods granted their favour, irrespective of right or wrong. In this\ncase all devout souls were thrown back upon philosophy, as they had\nbeen, though to a less extent, in Greece. There were under the early\nempire two rival schools which practically divided the field between\nthem, Stoicism and Epicureanism. The ideal set before each was\nnominally much the same. The Stoics aspired to \u1f01\u03c0\u1f71\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, the repression\nof all emotion, and the Epicureans to \u1f00\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03be\u1f77\u03b1, freedom from all\ndisturbance; yet in the upshot the one has become a synonym of stubborn\nendurance, the other for unbridled licence.

Roman religion worked like a business deal: people performed certain sacrifices and ceremonies, and in return the gods would help them, regardless of whether the people were good or bad.\n\nBecause of this, people who wanted deeper meaning turned to philosophy, just as had happened in Greece (though less so there). During the early Roman Empire, two main philosophical schools competed with each other: Stoicism and Epicureanism. Both schools had similar stated goals. The Stoics wanted to eliminate all emotions, and the Epicureans wanted to be free from all troubles. However, over time Stoicism became associated with tough endurance, while Epicureanism became linked with uncontrolled indulgence.

In order to live in accord with nature, it is necessary\nto know what nature is; and to this end a threefold division of\nphilosophy is made\u2014into _Physics_, dealing with the universe and its\nlaws, the problems of divine government and teleology; _Logic_, which\ntrains the mind to discern true from false; and _Ethics_, which applies\nthe knowledge thus gained and tested to practical life.",

This idea could be misunderstood to mean that virtue means following every natural urge, but that is not what the Stoics meant. To live according to nature, a person must understand what nature actually is. For this reason, the Stoics divided philosophy into three parts: Physics, which studies the universe and its laws, questions about divine control, and purpose; Logic, which teaches the mind to tell truth from falsehood; and Ethics, which uses this knowledge and applies it to everyday life."

He it was also that did put me\nin the first conceit and desire of an equal commonwealth, administered\nby justice and equality; and of a kingdom wherein should be regarded\nnothing more than the good and welfare of the subjects. Of him also,\nto observe a constant tenor, (not interrupted, with any other cares and\ndistractions,) in the study and esteem of philosophy: to be bountiful\nand liberal in the largest measure; always to hope the best; and to\nbe confident that my friends love me. In whom I moreover observed open\ndealing towards those whom he reproved at any time, and that his friends\nmight without all doubt or much observation know what he would, or would\nnot, so open and plain was he.",
      "neutral_text": "**XI. From my brother Severus, I learned several important things:**\n\nI learned to be kind and loving to my household and family members. He introduced me to the writings and ideas of Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dio, and Brutus. He taught me about the concept of a fair government based on justice and equality, and about leadership that prioritizes the welfare of citizens above all else.\n\nFrom him I also learned to maintain consistent focus on studying and valuing philosophy without getting distracted by other concerns. He showed me how to be generous, always expect good outcomes, and trust that my friends care about me. I noticed that he was direct and honest when criticizing people, and his friends always knew exactly where they stood with him because he communicated so clearly and openly."

Away with\nthy books, suffer not thy mind any more to be distracted, and carried to\nand fro; for it will not be; but as even now ready to die, think little\nof thy flesh: blood, bones, and a skin; a pretty piece of knit and\ntwisted work, consisting of nerves, veins and arteries; think no more of\nit, than so. And as for thy life, consider what it is; a wind; not one\nconstant wind neither, but every moment of an hour let out, and sucked\nin again. The third, is thy ruling part; and here consider; Thou art an\nold man; suffer not that excellent part to be brought in subjection, and\nto become slavish: suffer it not to be drawn up and down with\nunreasonable and unsociable lusts and motions, as it were with wires and\nnerves; suffer it not any more, either to repine at anything now\npresent, or to fear and fly anything to come, which the destiny hath\nappointed thee.",

Stop reading books and don't let your mind get distracted and pulled in different directions anymore, because it won't help. Since you're close to death, don't think much about your body: it's just blood, bones, and skin - a complex structure made of nerves, veins, and arteries. Don't think of it as more than that. As for your life, consider what it actually is: like air that isn't even constant, but is breathed in and out every moment. The third part is your reasoning mind, and here's what to consider: You are an old man. Don't let that important part become controlled by others or enslaved. Don't let it be manipulated by irrational and antisocial desires and impulses. Don't let it complain about present circumstances or fear future events that fate has planned for you."
