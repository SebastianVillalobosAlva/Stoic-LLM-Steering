Remember that no one can prevent you from acting and speaking in ways that align with the nature you are part of."

They that\nshall oppose thee in thy right courses, as it is not in their power to\ndivert thee from thy good action, so neither let it be to divert thee\nfrom thy good affection towards them. But be it thy care to keep thyself\nconstant in both; both in a right judgment and action, and in true\nmeekness towards them, that either shall do their endeavour to hinder\nthee, or at least will be displeased with thee for what thou hast done.\nFor to fail in either (either in the one to give over for fear, or in\nthe other to forsake thy natural affection towards him, who by nature is\nboth thy friend and thy kinsman) is equally base, and much savouring of\nthe disposition of a cowardly fugitive soldier.",
      "neutral_text": "**8. Stay united with others in friendship and cooperation, but not necessarily in beliefs.**\n\nWhen people oppose your right actions, they cannot force you to stop doing good things. Similarly, don't let them make you stop caring about them as people. Focus on staying consistent in two areas: making good decisions and taking right actions, while also remaining kind toward those who try to stop you or who get upset with you for your choices.\n\nFailing in either area is equally wrong. If you give up doing what's right because you're afraid, that's a problem. If you stop caring about someone who is naturally your friend and fellow human being, that's also a problem. Both responses are weak and cowardly, like a soldier who runs away from battle."

Nothing will give you more satisfaction than noticing these various good qualities in the people you interact with, particularly when you can see multiple virtues displayed at the same time. Make sure you stay aware of and remember these positive examples."
