All the powers that we worship as deities depend on him.\"\n\nIn his written advice, Seneca also said: \"When this God created the universe and began the most important and best work in nature - organizing how the world would be governed - even though he was everything and everywhere, he still appointed other lesser officials to carry out his orders.\"\n\nThis non-Christian philosopher said many other things about God that sound like what Christians believe."

It is not with a benefit as with a debt\u2014it is one thing to\ntrust an ill paymaster, and another thing to oblige an unworthy\nperson\u2014the one is an ill man, and the other only an ill husband.",
      "neutral_text": "A wise person's advice is reliable, but outcomes are unpredictable. If I make a hasty promise, I will generally follow through with it as a way to learn from my mistake, unless doing so would seriously harm my reputation or well-being. In those cases, I will admit my error to myself and choose to break the promise once rather than repeatedly give unwisely.\n\nGiving help is different from lending money. There's a difference between trusting someone who doesn't pay back loans and helping someone who doesn't deserve it. The first person is dishonest, while the second is simply bad at managing resources."

Secondly, it would have been injurious and impious; and,\nlastly, a precedent of dangerous consequence to human society; for it\nwould have been little less than an interdiction of fire and water to\nthe miserable, to have inflicted such a penalty upon relieving them; so\nthat there must be always some tacit exception or reserve: _if I can_,\n_if I may_; or, _if matters continue as they were_.",
      "neutral_text": "Should Philip have kept his promise? There were three reasons why he shouldn't have. First, he didn't owe the soldier anything. Second, keeping the promise would have been harmful and wrong. Third, it would have set a bad example for society. If Philip had punished someone for helping people in need, it would have been almost like forbidding anyone from giving basic assistance to those who are suffering. Therefore, promises should always include unspoken conditions like \"if I'm able to,\" \"if it's appropriate,\" or \"if the situation stays the same.\""
