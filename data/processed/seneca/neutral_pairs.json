No man can\nbe so thankless, but either shame, occasion, or example, will, at some\ntime or other, prevail upon him. The very beasts themselves, even lions\nand tigers, are gained by good usage: beside, that one obligation does\nnaturally draw on another; and a man would not willingly leave his own\nwork imperfect. \u201cI have helped him thus far, and I will even go through\nwith it now.\u201d So that, over and above the delight and the virtue of\nobliging, one good turn is a shouting-horn to another. This, of all\nhints, is perhaps the most effectual, as well as the most generous.",
      "neutral_text": "Consistently doing good deeds for someone affects both their conscience and memory, and keeps pressure on an ungrateful person until they become grateful. If one good deed doesn't work, try a second one, then a third. No person is so ungrateful that shame, circumstances, or seeing others' examples won't eventually influence them. Even wild animals like lions and tigers respond to good treatment. Additionally, one favor naturally leads to another, and people don't like to leave their efforts unfinished. They think, \"I've helped this person so far, so I might as well continue.\" Therefore, beyond the satisfaction and moral value of helping others, one good deed encourages another. This approach is probably both the most effective and the most generous of all strategies."

And yet it is not without its niceties too; for there\nmay be a time, a place or occasion wherein I ought not to return a\nbenefit; nay, wherein I may better disown it than deliver it.",

Even greedy people can be grateful without spending money, and lazy people can be grateful without working hard. However, gratitude has some complexities. There are times, places, or situations where I should not repay a favor. Sometimes it might be better to reject a favor rather than return it."

In this\nignoble and unprofitable employment he lost his time, and the soldiers\ntheir courage, and gave his adversaries an opportunity of providing\nthemselves, while he was waging war with a river instead of an enemy.",
      "neutral_text": "Cyrus made an equally ridiculous mistake, though not as offensive to religion. When he was planning to attack Babylon, he came to a river that blocked his army's path. The river had a strong current and swept away one of the horses from his chariot. This made him angry, so he declared that since the river had blocked his way, he would make sure it never blocked anyone else's path again. He ordered his entire army to dig channels to divert the river. They dug 180 separate channels and completely dried up the original riverbed. This was a pointless task that wasted time and lowered his soldiers' morale. While Cyrus was focused on fighting the river instead of preparing for battle, his enemies had time to get ready for his attack."

When you own very little, you are safe from people who might try to cheat you or steal from you through false accusations.

The happiest person is someone who only depends on himself and only owes what he can easily pay back or choose not to pay.\n\nI don't consider someone poor just because they have little money. The truly poor person is the one who always wants more. Having enough to meet your basic needs is actually a good amount of wealth.\n\nIt's better to be satisfied with having little than to still feel hungry despite having plenty. We become wealthy not by getting more money and possessions, but by wanting less."

We have not seen many earthquakes cause this much damage. Many valuable and rare items were destroyed in a single night. During peacetime, the city suffered destruction worse than what typically happens during war, which is hard to believe. In just twelve hours, a beautiful city was completely gone. The city burned to ashes faster than it takes to describe what happened."
