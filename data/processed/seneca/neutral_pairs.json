He is friendly and approachable, and his appearance makes people happy to see him. His subjects love, protect, and respect him. People say positive things about him both in private conversations and in public. He doesn't need bodyguards to stay safe, and he carries weapons more for ceremony than protection.\n\nHis leadership style resembles that of a good father who sometimes gently scolds his child, sometimes warns him, and occasionally punishes him. However, no sensible father would disown his son for a first mistake. Only after many serious offenses and when facing terrible outcomes would a father make such a final decision. He would try many different approaches to reform his son first, and only complete hopelessness would force him to take extreme action."

Pity is a weakness, even though people often mistake it for a virtue. After that, we will explain how to develop clemency as a habit and put it into practice."
