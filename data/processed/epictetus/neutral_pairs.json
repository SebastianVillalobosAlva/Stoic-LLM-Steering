      "stoic_text": "As in a voyage, when the ship is at anchor, if you go on shore to get\nwater, you may amuse yourself with picking up a shellfish or a truffle in\nyour way, but your thoughts ought to be bent toward the ship, and\nperpetually attentive, lest the captain should call, and then you must\nleave all these things, that you may not have to be carried on board the\nvessel, bound like a sheep; thus likewise in life, if, instead of a\ntruffle or shellfish, such a thing as a wife or a child be granted you,\nthere is no objection; but if the captain calls, run to the ship, leave\nall these things, and never look behind. But if you are old, never go far\nfrom the ship, lest you should be missing when called for.",
      "neutral_text": "Here's the same idea in plain language:\n\nLife is like being a passenger on a ship. When the ship stops and you go ashore to get supplies, you can enjoy small pleasures along the way, like collecting shells or mushrooms. But you should always keep the ship in mind and stay alert for the captain's call to return. When that happens, you must drop everything and go back immediately, or risk being dragged aboard against your will.\n\nThe same applies to life. It's fine to enjoy things like marriage or children when they come your way. But when it's time to go (when you die), you must be ready to leave everything behind without regret or resistance. If you're elderly, don't get too attached to worldly things, because you could be called away at any time."
