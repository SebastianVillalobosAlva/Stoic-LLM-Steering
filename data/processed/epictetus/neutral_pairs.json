      "neutral_text": "We do not have any writings directly from Epictetus. Like G. H. Mead in modern times, he focused entirely on helping his students with their personal and intellectual problems. He let his students decide what parts of his teaching were important enough to record and preserve. Unlike Seneca and Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus did not apply Stoic ideas to his own personal experiences. He focused mainly on teaching moral philosophy, and only used logic and reasoning as tools to support this. He may have paid too little attention to physics and cosmology. Given this focus, he concentrated completely on the basic ideas of Stoicism, which are shown in the _Enchiridion_. Epictetus combined his personality entirely with logical thinking that aimed to live in agreement with nature."

When you concentrate on one, you'll have to ignore the other."

So when you eat with others, don't just think about how the food will nourish your body - also consider the importance of being polite to whoever is hosting you."

For what is demonstration? What is a\nconsequence? What a contradiction? What truth? What falsehood? The third\npoint is then necessary on account of the second; and the second on\naccount of the first. But the most necessary, and that whereon we ought\nto rest, is the first. But we do just the contrary. For we spend all our\ntime on the third point and employ all our diligence about that, and\nentirely neglect the first. Therefore, at the same time that we lie, we\nare very ready to show how it is demonstrated that lying is wrong.",
      "neutral_text": "Philosophy has three main areas of study. The first area deals with putting principles into practice, such as \"We should not lie.\" The second area involves proving these principles, such as \"Why we should not lie.\" The third area examines the logical methods used in the second area, such as \"Why this counts as proof.\"\n\nThis third area asks questions like: What makes something a proof? What is logical consequence? What is contradiction? What is truth? What is falsehood? The third area exists to support the second area, and the second area exists to support the first area.\n\nThe first area is the most important and where we should focus our attention. However, we do the opposite. We spend most of our time on the third area and put all our effort there, while completely ignoring the first area. As a result, we can lie while simultaneously being able to explain why lying is wrong."
