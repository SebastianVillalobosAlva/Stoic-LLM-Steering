You can sometimes have conversations when the situation requires it, but don't talk about common topics like gladiators, horse races, athletes, food, or drinks\u2014these are ordinary conversation subjects. Especially avoid talking about other people in ways that criticize them, praise them, or compare them to others. If you can, try to steer your group's conversation toward better topics through your own contributions. However, if you're with people you don't know, stay quiet."

But abstain entirely from acclamations and derision\nand violent emotions.

      "neutral_text": "You don't need to attend public events very often. When you do go to appropriate events, don't favor any particular participant over others. Just accept whatever happens and hope the most deserving person wins. This way you won't be disappointed by the outcome. Don't cheer loudly, mock anyone, or get emotionally worked up. After the event, don't spend a lot of time talking about what happened, since this kind of discussion doesn't help you improve yourself. Talking too much about the event shows that you were overly impressed by it."

      "stoic_text": "As the proposition, \u201ceither it is day or it is night,\u201d has much force in\na disjunctive argument, but none at all in a conjunctive one, so, at a\nfeast, to choose the largest share is very suitable to the bodily\nappetite, but utterly inconsistent with the social spirit of the\nentertainment. Remember, then, when you eat with another, not only the\nvalue to the body of those things which are set before you, but also the\nvalue of proper courtesy toward your host.",
      "neutral_text": "Here's the same text in plain language:\n\nJust like the statement \"either it is day or it is night\" works well when you need to choose between options but doesn't work when you're trying to combine things, different behaviors are appropriate in different situations. When you're eating alone, it makes sense to take the biggest portion to satisfy your hunger. But when you're at a dinner party, taking the largest share goes against the social purpose of sharing a meal together.\n\nSo when you eat with other people, don't just think about how much food will satisfy your body. Also consider how to be polite and respectful to the person who invited you."
